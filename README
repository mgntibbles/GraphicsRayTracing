To run:
- running open index.html in terminal will open the page on the browser
- you will need to pick one or two files (either just .txt file or .obj file as well). It is a multi-select file reader so you need to select them both and then click open
- The image will appear, it will take time depending on the shape.

Notes:
- You will need to reset the page before loading a new file
- the bigger/more complex objects will take longer to load. For example, the cube takes about 2 seconds to load and the torus takes about a minute to load. 
- I don't think the rotations work perfectly
